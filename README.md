# OroLight: Oral Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

**OroLight** is a web-based deep learning application that classifies oral histopathology images as **cancerous** or **non-cancerous**. It integrates a trained **InceptionResNetV2** model within a Flask app and provides Grad-CAM visualizations for interoperability.

## Features

* Upload and classify oral histopathology images
* Uses **InceptionResNetV2** for high accuracy
* Includes **Grad-CAM** to visualize model attention
* Fully styled UI with animations
* Training notebook with graphs and metrics

---

## Model Training and Performance

The model is trained on the **[Oral Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaidpy/oral-cancer-dataset)** by ZaidPy.

> Achieved **90%** accuracy using transfer learning and fine-tuning.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jasmine5220/orolight.git
cd orolight
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # MacOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

### 3. Download the Dataset
1. Go to the dataset page:
   🔗 [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaidpy/oral-cancer-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaidpy/oral-cancer-dataset)
2. Download the zip folder of the dataset.

### 4. Train the Model
Run the training notebook.

This will:
* Load and preprocess images
* Train an InceptionResNetV2-based classifier
* Save the best model as `best_model.h5` in `orolight` folder

### 5. Move the Model to the Correct Directory
After training completes:
```bash
mv best_model.h5 oral_cancer_app/model/
```

### 6. Go to Flask App and Install Required Packages
```bash
cd oral_cancer_app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or manually:
```bash
pip install flask tensorflow keras opencv-python matplotlib numpy pandas
```

### 7. Run the Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```

## Example Test Images
Inside `Tests/`, you’ll find:
* `real-test-1.jpg`
* `real-test-2.jpg`

*These are sample images(taken in Jabalpur Medical College), you can upload via the web app to test the model.*
